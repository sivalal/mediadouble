If you choose to register for the Services, you can find the specific details regarding your membership with us at any time by visiting the "Account Membership" page.  We may offer a number of membership plans with different limitations. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered membership plans. We may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes. However, we may not always be able to notify you of changes in any applicable taxes. Any materially different terms from those described in these TOU will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you.</span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c0">7.2           Free Trials.  From time to time, we may provide you with free trials, free Content, and other special offers.  To use these offers, you must have Internet access, and you may be required to have a current valid accepted payment method as indicated during sign-up (“Payment Method”) to use the offer.  Depending on the offer you choose, we may begin billing your Payment Method for monthly membership fees at the end of the free trial period or promotion, unless you cancel prior to the end of the period.  You agree that your Payment Method may be authorized for up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register. In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization; however, no charges will be made against the Payment Method unless you do not cancel prior to the end of your free trial period</span><span class="c1">[MM8] </span><span class="c0">. You may not receive a notice from us that your free trial period has ended or that the paying portion of your membership has begun. If YOU CANCEL PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR FREE TRIAL, THERE WILL BE NO CHARGES TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. We will continue to bill your Payment Method on a monthly basis for your membership fee until you cancel (see “Cancellation” below).   Such free-trial offers may also be subject to additional terms and conditions provided to you during sign-up. </span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c0">7.3           Billing.  By starting your membership, you are expressly agreeing that we or any payment agents of ours are authorized to charge you a recurring monthly membership fee at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Services, including any applicable taxes, to the Payment Method you provided during registration. The membership fee will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership or your Payment Method fails or expires. Visit our Site and click on the "Account Membership" page to see the commencement date for your next renewal period</span><span class="c1">[MM9] </span><span class="c0">.

The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance. WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS FOR ANY PARTIAL-MONTH MEMBERSHIP PERIODS OR UNWATCHED MOVIES OR SHOWS PRIOR TO THEIR EXPIRATION DATE.

      <p class="c5"><b>12.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. </b></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c0">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c10"><span class="c0 c14">In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, you and we agree that any legal or equitable claim arising out of or relating in any way to your use of the Services or these TOU, and the formation, validity, enforceability, scope, or applicability of this TOU, including this Section [12] (referred to as a “Claim”) will be resolved as follows:</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c10"><span class="c0 c14">(a)   Informal   Resolution.   We will first try to resolve any Claim informally. Accordingly, neither of us may start a formal proceeding (except for Claims described in Section [12](d) below) for at least 60 days after one of us notifies the other of a Claim in writing. You will send your notice to [XXX]</span><span class="c12">[MM13] </span><span class="c0 c14">, and we will send our notice to your billing address.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c10"><span class="c0 c14">(b)   Formal Resolution. Except as provided in Section [12](d), if we cannot resolve a Claim informally, any Claim either of us asserts will be resolved only by binding arbitration and not in courts of general jurisdiction. The arbitration will be conducted under the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to as the “JAMS Rules”) and under the rules set forth in this TOU. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in this TOU, the rules set forth in this TOU will govern. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state’s law. If you decide to initiate arbitration, we agree to pay the arbitration initiation fee and any additional deposit required by JAMS to initiate your arbitration. We also agree to pay the costs of the arbitration proceeding. Other fees, such as attorney’s fees and expenses of travel to the arbitration, will be paid in accordance with JAMS Rules. The arbitration will be held at a location in your hometown area unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration. To start an arbitration, you or we must do the following things:</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c10"><span class="c0 c14">(1)        Write a Demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at </span><span class="c0 c14 c19"><a class="c18" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jamsadr.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHLClrX4JxrII9iXk2M57lToeeKhg">www.jamsadr.com.</a></span></p>
      <p class="c5 c10"><span class="c0 c14">(2)        Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to:</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c10"><span class="c0 c14">JAMS </span></p>
      <p class="c5 c10"><span class="c0 c14">500 North State College Blvd., Suite 600 </span></p>

      <p class="c5 c10"><span class="c0 c14">3)         Send one copy of the demand for arbitration to us.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c10"><span class="c0 c14">(c)   Special Rules. (i) In the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator has no authority to make errors of law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator does so. Otherwise, the arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any federal or state court that has jurisdiction. (ii) Neither you nor we shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity. Accordingly, you and we agree that the JAMS Class Action Procedures do not apply to our arbitration. A court may sever any portion of Section [12] that it finds to be unenforceable, except for the prohibition on class, representative and private attorney general arbitration.</span></p>
      <p class="c5 c10"><span class="c0 c14">(d)   Exceptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing: any dispute involving a violation of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. § 605, or the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 1201, or the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2521, or any other statement or law governing theft of service, may be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction. You may also assert an individual action in small claims court in lieu of arbitration.</span></p>
